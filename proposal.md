# The Next Town Over

## Repository

## Description
A short text-based choose-your-own adventure game. The game runs exclusively on Python via the Terminal to tell a story and prompt the user to interact and have fun!!!

## Features
- Character Stats
	- The player will be able to pick what aspects/skills to put their skills into. This will be referenced throughout the game. It will be executed via dedicated methods to calculating success rate.
- Decisions that matter
	- When certain choices are made, a flag will be made True or False, and can be referenced in the future as to whether or not an action can be performed
- Multiple story paths
	- Because of the multiple options players are able to choose, there are different story branches available

## Challenges
- need to better understand how variables can be referenced in and out of specific functions/loops
- how to structure text in the terminal? is there an ability to mess with font? speed at which its written?
- also need to look into perhaps confining user input (for example not allowing users to type letters.)

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideal outcome would be a completely finished game (a bit of a reach), with several endings and decisions that feel meaningful.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A story! A start and expression of the skills learned! Proof of concept but a bit more elaborate!

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. figure out story
  2. start coding, figure out what i do/don't understand

- Week 2
  1. research into challenges
  2. figure out how to keep variables through different loops and functions

- Week N (Final)
  1. code 1 ending
  2. code 2 ending
