## Description
Welcome to 'The Next Town Over', a mini choose-your-own adventure text-based game!

The story follows Max, a young cowboy in the 1870's looking to explore the city outside of his small town for the first time. He has a little trouble getting there though...

All you need to play is to load the repository and run the script! In the Terminal, the story will unfold, prompting you to respond (and how to do it).
          
Players are given 10 skill points which they are able to distribute among OBSERVATION, CHARISMA, and STRENGTH. Based on their skill-levels and a little bit of luck, Players will either succesfully pass or fail skill checks. Skill checks are given a certain level of difficulty corresponding to the action it reflects. A random "roll of a dice" (random number generator 1-6) plus the skill-points in a given attribute make up a players "roll", if a player's roll meets or exceeds the minimum number requiered to pass the skill check, they are able to perform the choice, otherwise they are not.

Although I was not able to currently complete my project to the furthest extent I imagined (on account of the perfecionist in me wanting the writing to be "perfect") I still plan on working on it in the future! Coding this so far has been a fun challenge and often times feels like solving a puzzle. But boy is it rewarding once you figure it out. 

A few things I would want to work on further: address what happens when a player enters an invalid input. (I'm trusting you all to answer in number form and the occasional y/n. Honor code.)

To be honest, the hardest part about this process has been knowing exactly what to google.

I hope you can see the vision that I was striving for.
